This article is part of our [series on building a Chrome extension](../chrome-extension).

## Why add unit tests?

Unit tests help us catch bugs early, ensure our extension continues to work as expected in different scenarios, and make
it easier to refactor our code. In this article, we will add unit tests to our Chrome extension.

## Add Jest to the project {#add-jest-to-the-project}

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a popular JavaScript testing framework. We will use Jest to write and run unit tests for
our Chrome extension.

To install Jest, run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest jest-environment-jsdom ts-jest @types/jest
```

- [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) is the testing framework
- `jest-environment-jsdom` simulates a browser environment for Jest tests
- [ts-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest) allows Jest to work with TypeScript
- `@types/jest` provides TypeScript definitions for Jest

## Configure Jest

Create a `jest.config.ts` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```typescript
import type { JestConfigWithTsJest } from "ts-jest"

const config: JestConfigWithTsJest = {
    setupFiles: ["./__mocks__/chrome.ts"],
    testEnvironment: "jsdom",
    transform: {
        "^.+.ts$": ["ts-jest", {}],
    },
}
export default config

```

The `setupFiles` option loads a mock for the Chrome API. In the next step, we will create this mock.

The `testEnvironment` option sets a browser testing environment by default. We can override the environment at the top
of each test file:

```typescript
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */
```

The `transform` option specifies to process TypeScript test files with `ts-jest`.

## Create a mock for the Chrome API

Our extension code relies on the Chrome API, which is unavailable in our unit test environment. We will create a mock
for the Chrome API to simulate its behavior in our tests.

A mock is a fake implementation of a function or object that allows us to test our code in isolation. Mocks are helpful
for testing code that depends on external services or APIs.

Create a `__mocks__` folder in the root of the project. The `__mocks__` name is a Jest convention for mock files. In
that folder, add a `chrome.ts` file with the following content:

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment -- disable ESLint check for the next line
// @ts-nocheck -- this TS comment turns off TypeScript type checking for this file because we do not
// mock the entire Chrome API, but only the parts we need
global.chrome = {
    runtime: {
        onInstalled: {
            addListener: jest.fn(),
        },
        onMessage: {
            addListener: jest.fn(),
        },
        onStartup: {
            addListener: jest.fn(),
        },
        sendMessage: jest.fn(),
    },
    storage: {
        sync: {
            get: jest.fn(),
            set: jest.fn(),
        },
    },
}
```

The empty `jest.fn()` implementations can be replaced during testing with custom behavior using Jest's mocking functions
using [jest.spyOn](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname).

## Write a unit test {#write-a-unit-test}

We will test the `content.ts` file in our first unit test. This file contains the logic for the content script that runs
on web pages when the extension is active. The content script blurs a page element that contains a user-defined keyword.

Create a `content.test.ts` file in the `src` folder with the following content:

```typescript
import { blurFilter, observe, config } from "./content"

describe("blur", () => {
  test("blur a secret", () => {
    // Define the document (web page) that we will test against
    document.body.innerHTML = `
    <div id="testDiv">
      "My secret"
    </div>`
    // Set value to blur
    config.item = "secret"
    // Start observing the document.
    observe()
    // Make sure the element is blurred as expected
    const testDiv = document.getElementById("testDiv") as HTMLInputElement
    expect(testDiv).toBeDefined()
    expect(testDiv.style.filter).toBe(blurFilter)
  })
})
```

In the above test, the Jest functions `describe` and `test` define a test suite and a test case, respectively. The
`expect` function checks whether the test results match the expected values.

## Run the unit tests

The Jest unit test can be run using the following command:

```bash
npx jest
```

The result of the test should look like:

```
  console.debug
    blurred id:testDiv class: tag:DIV text:
          "My secret"

      at blurElement (src/content.ts:36:11)
          at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
          at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
          at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
          at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)

 PASS  src/content.test.ts
  blur
    âœ“ blur a secret (15 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.149 s
Ran all test suites.
```

Add the following script to the `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
}
```

Now you can run the tests using the `npm test` or `npm run test`.

## Review unit test coverage {#review-unit-test-coverage}

Code coverage measures how much of the code is tested by the unit tests. A high percentage indicates that most of the
code is tested and less likely to contain bugs. Code coverage is an important metric for assessing the quality of the
code. A common target for code coverage is 80% or higher.

Jest can generate a code coverage report to show which parts of the code are covered by the unit tests. To create a
coverage report, add the `--coverage` flag to the Jest command:

```bash
npx jest --coverage
```

The terminal output will include the code coverage summary:

```
------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|--------------------------
File        | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|--------------------------
All files   |   45.23 |    48.57 |   42.85 |   45.23 |
 content.ts |   45.23 |    48.57 |   42.85 |   45.23 | 22,26,50-54,62-69,88-117
------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|--------------------------
```

The full report is available in the `coverage` folder. Open the `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` file in a browser to
view the detailed coverage report.

Note that the code coverage report only includes the files in the test run. If you want to include all files in the
coverage report, we can add the `collectCoverageFrom` option to the `jest.config.ts` Jest configuration file:

```javascript
collectCoverageFrom: ["src/**/*.ts"],
```

Now, the report shows a complete picture:

```
---------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|--------------------------
File           | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
---------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|--------------------------
All files      |   16.96 |     30.9 |   10.71 |   16.96 |
 background.ts |       0 |        0 |       0 |       0 | 1-21
 common.ts     |       0 |        0 |       0 |       0 | 17-19
 content.ts    |   45.23 |    48.57 |   42.85 |   45.23 | 22,26,50-54,62-69,88-117
 options.ts    |       0 |        0 |       0 |       0 | 2-31
 popup.ts      |       0 |        0 |       0 |       0 | 1-86
---------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|--------------------------
```

## Adding unit tests to GitHub Actions

To make sure that our unit tests are run automatically on every push to the repository, we can add them to a GitHub
Actions workflow. In the [Linting and formatting TypeScript](../linting-and-formatting-typescript) article, we added
ESLint to GitHub Actions. We can add a step to run the Jest tests in the same workflow.

```yaml
      - name: Test
        run: |
          npm run test
```
