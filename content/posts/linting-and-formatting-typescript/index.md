This article is part of a series on [building a maintainable Chrome extension](../chrome-extension).

In the previous article, we
[added TypeScript code for communicating between parts of a Chrome extension](../message-passing-in-chrome-extension).
This check-in will be our starting point for this article. This article will add linting and formatting to our
TypeScript code, which will help us catch errors and enforce a consistent code style for larger teams.

## What is linting?

Linting is the process of running a static code analysis program to analyze code for potential errors. Linters can catch
syntax errors, typos, and other common mistakes that can lead to bugs. They can also enforce coding standards, such as
indentation, variable naming, and other style rules.

## What is formatting?

Formatting automatically changes the code's appearance to match a specific style guide. Formatting tools can
automatically add or remove whitespace, change indentation, and reformat code to make it more readable. Formatting tools
can enforce a consistent code style across a project.

## Why use linting and formatting tools?

Linters and formatters work together to help developers write better code and accelerate the development process --
linters flag errors, while formatters automatically enforce a consistent code style.

Together, they can help prevent bugs, improve code quality, and make it easier for developers to read and understand the
code. The result is cleaner, more maintainable code that uses many coding best practices and is easier to work with.

Linting can also teach developers about best practices and help them avoid common pitfalls. For example, a linter can
flag misused promises, such as missing `await` or uncaught errors.

## Setting up linting with ESLint and typescript-eslint {#setting-up-linting}

To set up linting for TypeScript code, we will use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the
[typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/) plugin. ESLint is a popular linter that can analyze JavaScript and
TypeScript code. The typescript-eslint plugin adds TypeScript-specific rules to ESLint.

To set up ESLint with typescript-eslint, we need to install the following packages:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint @eslint/js @types/eslint__js typescript-eslint
```

Next, we need to create an ESLint configuration file. We will create an `eslint.config.mjs` file at the root of our
project:

```javascript
// @ts-check

import eslint from '@eslint/js'
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint"

const config = tseslint.config(
    eslint.configs.recommended,
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
    {
        ignores: ["dist/**/*"],
    },
    {
        languageOptions: {
            parserOptions: {
                project: true,
                tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
            },
        },
    },
)

export default config
```

This configuration file sets up ESLint with the recommended TypeScript type-checked rules and ignores our `dist`
directory containing the webpack-generated bundles.

### Why use the `.mjs` extension instead of `.js` for the configuration file?

We are using `.mjs` extension for the configuration file to take advantage of ECMAScript modules. Using ES modules
allows us to import and export modules using the `import` and `export` keywords. There are other ways to enable
ECMAScript modules in JavaScript for our project, but this is the simplest way for just one JavaScript file. Our
TypeScript files already use ECMAScript modules via these included recommended `tsconfig.json` settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
```

If we used `.js` extension for the configuration file, we would need to use `require` and `module.exports` syntax.
Otherwise, we would get an error like this:

```

import eslint from '@eslint/js'
^^^^^^

```

## Running ESLint

We can run ESLint from the command line using the following command:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/eslint .
```

Alternatively, we can use `npx`, which is a package runner tool that comes with npm:

```bash
npx eslint .
```

This command will run ESLint on all TypeScript files in the current directory and subdirectories. ESLint will output any
errors or warnings it finds in the code, such as:

```
/Users/victor/work/create-chrome-extension/4-linting-and-formatting/src/background.ts
  14:17  error  Unsafe member access .enabled on an `any` value  @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access

/Users/victor/work/create-chrome-extension/4-linting-and-formatting/src/content.ts
  51:9   error  Unsafe assignment of an `any` value              @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment
  74:17  error  Unsafe member access .enabled on an `any` value  @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access
  76:9   error  Unsafe assignment of an `any` value              @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment
  76:27  error  Unsafe member access .enabled on an `any` value  @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access

/Users/victor/work/create-chrome-extension/4-linting-and-formatting/src/popup.ts
   9:23  error  Unsafe argument of type `any` assigned to a parameter of type `boolean`  @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument
  11:37  error  Promise returned in function argument where a void return was expected   @typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises
  23:34  error  Unsafe member access .title on an `any` value                            @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access
  23:50  error  Unsafe member access .url on an `any` value                              @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access
  43:5   error  Unsafe assignment of an `any` value                                      @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment

âœ– 10 problems (10 errors, 0 warnings)
```

At this point, we should fix the errors and warnings that ESLint has found in our code.

We can also update the `scripts` section of our `package.json` file to run ESLint with `npm run`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
```

Now we can run ESLint with the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Setting up formatting with Prettier {#setting-up-formatting}

To format TypeScript code, we will use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a popular code formatter that
automatically formats code to match a specific style guide.

To set up Prettier, we need to install the following package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
```

Next, create a `.prettierignore` file in the root of our project to ignore the `dist` directory:

```
/dist
```

By default, Prettier ignores the `node_modules` directory.

Next, create a `.prettierrc` file in the root of our project to configure Prettier:

```json
{
  "semi": false
}
```

We will use the default Prettier settings but turn off the `semi` rule to remove semicolons from the end of TypeScript
lines. Removing semicolons is a common style choice in modern JavaScript and TypeScript code.

## Running Prettier

We can run Prettier from the command line using the following command:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

This command will format all eligible files in the current directory and subdirectories.

We can also update the `scripts` section of our `package.json` file to run Prettier with the following command:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "format-check": "prettier --check .",
```

`npm run format` will format all eligible files, while `npm run format-check` will check if the files are formatted.

## Adding linting and formatting to continuous integration (CI) {#adding-linting-and-formatting-to-ci}

We will use GitHub Actions to automate linting and formatting checks on every pull request and commit to our main
branch. This will make sure all code changes are linted and formatted correctly on the main branch.

This automatic check means that all contributors can expect that the code they are working on uses a consistent style
and meets a quality standard. Consistency is beneficial for open-source projects where contributors may not be familiar
with the codebase.

To set up GitHub Actions, create a `.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml` file in the root of our git repository:

```yaml
name: Lint check, format check, and build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths: # We only run the workflow if the code in these files/directories changes
      - '.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml' # This file
      - '4-linting-and-formatting/**' # The working directory for this article
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml'
      - '4-linting-and-formatting/**'

# This allows a subsequently queued workflow run to interrupt previous runs
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.run_id}}
  cancel-in-progress: true

defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash
    working-directory: ./4-linting-and-formatting


permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  lint-format-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm install --no-save

      - name: Format check and lint
        run: |
          npm run format-check
          npm run lint

      - name: Build
        run: |
          npm run build

```

Since our git repository is shared by multiple projects (from various articles), we use the `paths` key to only run the
workflow when the code in the `4-linting-and-formatting` directory changes.

After pushing our code to GitHub and waiting for the GitHub Actions workflow to run, we can see the results in the
Actions tab of our repository. We can see the linting and formatting checks, as well as the build step:

{{< figure src="github-lint-format-build-workflow-result.png" title="GitHub Actions workflow results" alt="GitHub Actions workflow results" >}}

For more details on GitHub Actions workflows, see our article on
[reusing GitHub Actions workflows and steps](../github-reusable-workflows-and-steps/).

## Adding stricter linting rules to typescript-eslint

The `recommended` ruleset is a good starting point for linting TypeScript code. However, we can add stricter rules to
catch even more potential issues in our code. It is easiest to start with strict rules early in the project when fixing
issues is relatively painless. Otherwise, it is a good idea to gradually add stricter rules to avoid overwhelming
developers with too many errors and warnings.

To switch to a stricter, more opinionated ruleset, replace `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` with
`tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked` in the `eslint.config.mjs` file.

ESLint rules can be configured or disabled using configuration comments in the code or the ESLint configuration file.
For more details, see the [ESLint configure rules](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules).

## Next steps

In the next part of this series, we will add an options page to our Chrome extension. This page will allow users to
configure the extension's behavior and settings.
