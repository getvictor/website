We are creating a series of articles on building a production-ready Chrome extension. In this series, we cover the
basics of building a Chrome extension, how to set up industry leading development tooling, and how to test and deploy
your extension. Our goal is to show you how to build a Chrome extension that is easy to maintain, test, and deploy for a
software development team.

### [Create a Chrome extension from scratch](../create-chrome-extension)

Create a basic Chrome extension without any development tools. We cover the basics such as the major parts of the
extension, `manifest.json`, and manually testing the extension in the Chrome browser.

### [Add webpack and TypeScript to a Chrome extension](../add-webpack-and-typescript-to-chrome-extension)

We add support for TypeScript (which replaces JavaScript) and webpack (which bundles the extension) to our Chrome
extension.

### [Message passing in a Chrome extension](../message-passing-in-chrome-extension)

We cover message passing communication between different parts of a Chrome extension. We dive into the code and show how
to communicate between the service worker (background script), content scripts, and the popup.

### [Linting and formatting TypeScript in a Chrome extension](../linting-and-formatting-typescript)

We set up ESLint and Prettier to lint and format our TypeScript code. This ensures our code is consistent and follows
best practices.

### [Add options page to Chrome extension](../add-options-to-chrome-extension)

We add an advanced options page to our Chrome extension. This page allows users to configure the extension's behavior
and settings.

### [Add CSS framework to Chrome extension](../add-css-framework-to-chrome-extension)

We improve the look and maintainability of our extension by adding a CSS framework. We use Tailwind CSS to quickly style
our extension and make it look professional.
