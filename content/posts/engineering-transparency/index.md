Let me take you back a couple of years. I was a tech lead at a large company, working on a project that depended on
another upstream engineering team. Every week, we’d have a joint meeting with both teams. And every week, I’d ask the
same question, trying to keep my tone professional:

> “Hey Alex, any update on that component we need from your side?”

And every week, Alex would say:

> "Ah, I meant to, but I got pulled into something else. I'll try to get to it this week."

At first, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Stuff happens. Priorities shift.

But then it kept happening. Two weeks, three, four. Same story. No progress. No accountability. No one stepping in.

I was _boiling_ inside.

I kept thinking:

> “Why is no one telling Alex to work on this? Why don't we have a project manager? Who’s making the call on what really
> matters?”

We technically had a roadmap. But, let's be honest: people didn't really take it seriously. If something couldn't get
done, it just quietly disappeared from the plan. Deadlines slipped. Commitments evaporated. And meanwhile, I had to face
my boss with another non-update, again.

The frustration started eating at me. I'd sit in those meetings and darker thoughts would creep in:

> "How did Alex even get promoted? He can't deliver anything."

> "Why am I killing myself here when clearly no one cares? Maybe I should take off for the rest of the day."

> "Should I just get a side gig? At least someone would pay me for work that actually ships."

This wasn't just a few bad weeks. This was years of my life. Years of pretending everything was fine when it wasn't.
Years of wondering if this was just how companies worked.

I'd go home exhausted, not from hard work, but from the sheer weight of organizational dysfunction. My wife would ask
how my day was, and I'd just shrug. What was there to say? Another day, another meeting, another non-update.

Then I switched companies.

And everything changed.

In my new role, everyone had access to clear company priorities: what we were building, why it was important, which
customer requests were critical, and who our key customers were. Engineers were empowered to make their own decisions
based on this shared context. If someone couldn't deliver, they openly communicated why and offered alternatives
grounded in the company's priorities.

There was no hiding or pretending. Just reality, laid bare.

That's when it hit me. The problem at my old company wasn't Alex. He wasn't slacking off. He was overwhelmed, like the
rest of us. Everyone was reacting to noise instead of following signal. No one had the authority, or the clarity, to say
what actually mattered.

**This wasn't a communication problem. It was a trust and transparency problem.** And the absence of that created a
frustrating, demoralizing fog. Everyone thought they were doing the right thing, yet nothing moved forward.

That experience changed my understanding of leadership.

Because here's the truth: Without shared visibility and shared accountability, even the best engineers will lose
direction. Polite status meetings won’t save you from a broken system.

As leaders, our job isn't just to set direction. It's to make the invisible visible and to make sure it matters.
