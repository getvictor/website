&lt;h2 id="what-are-package-dependencies-and-module-dependencies">&lt;a href="#what-are-package-dependencies-and-module-dependencies" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>What are package dependencies and module dependencies?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A package dependency is another package that your Go package imports. When you import a package in Go, you create a dependency on that package. The Go compiler will not compile your package if it cannot find and compile the package you depend on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, a module dependency is a dependency on a module. A module is a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together. You declare your module dependencies in your &lt;code>go.mod&lt;/code> file. Your code may use one or more packages from your module dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-are-package-dependencies-important">&lt;a href="#why-are-package-dependencies-important" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>Why are package dependencies important?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Understanding your package dependencies is essential because they:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>indicate the amount of internal coupling in your codebase&lt;/li>
&lt;li>help you understand the structure of your codebase&lt;/li>
&lt;li>help you avoid too many dependencies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>help you avoid circular dependencies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>help you optimize your build times&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As your codebase grows, keeping track of package dependencies is vital to ensure that the codebase remains maintainable. Many developers import dependencies without considering the consequences. In modern IDE tools, they quickly click &lt;code>Import&lt;/code> in a pop-up to make the squiggly lines go away. In some cases, IDEs add imports without even asking the developer. However, code with many dependencies becomes coupled to other potentially unrelated code. This entanglement makes the codebase harder to understand, test, and maintain. For additional details, see &lt;a class="link" href="../scaling-codebase-evolutionary-architecture/#problems-with-the-current-architecture" >the list of problems with a coupled architecture&lt;/a> from our previous article.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-an-architectural-test">&lt;a href="#what-is-an-architectural-test" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>What is an architectural test?
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>An architectural test is a test that makes sure your code follows the architectural rules that you have defined. Codebases tend to devolve into a Big Ball of Mud as time passes. Architectural tests are one way to keep your codebase clean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our example below, we will check to ensure that our Go package is NOT dependent on another package in our codebase. This is a common scenario when you want to refactor your codebase and remove a dependency or add a new package and want to ensure that it is not dependent on other parts of the codebase.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="find-package-dependencies-using-go-list">&lt;a href="#find-package-dependencies-using-go-list" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>Find package dependencies using &lt;code>go list&lt;/code>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;code>go list&lt;/code> is a powerful tool that you can use to list information about Go packages. You can use the &lt;code>-deps&lt;/code> flag with &lt;code>go list&lt;/code> to find package dependencies. Here is an example:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>go list -deps ./server/android...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The result is a list of all the direct and indirect package dependencies of the &lt;code>./server/android&lt;/code> and its subpackages. To filter out standard library packages and sort the list, you can use the following command on macOS:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>go list -deps ./server/android... | grep -E &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;^[^\/]*\.[^\/]*\/&amp;#39;&lt;/span> | sort
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The above regular expression looks for packages with a &lt;code>.&lt;/code> before the first &lt;code>/&lt;/code> in the package path. This regex filters out standard library packages. The &lt;code>sort&lt;/code> command sorts the list alphabetically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To check if a package is dependent on another package, you can use the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>! &lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>go list -deps ./server/android... | grep -q &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;github.com/fleetdm/fleet/v4/server/mdm/nanomdm/mdm&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The leading &lt;code>!&lt;/code> inverts the command&amp;rsquo;s exit status. If the package is dependent on the specified package, the command will return &lt;code>1&lt;/code>; if it is not, the command will return &lt;code>0&lt;/code>. You can use this command in your CI/CD pipelines to ensure that your package is not dependent on a specific package.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="find-package-dependencies-using-go-code">&lt;a href="#find-package-dependencies-using-go-code" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>Find package dependencies using Go code
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>packages&lt;/a> is a Go package that allows one to load, parse, type-check, and import Go packages. We will use the &lt;code>Load&lt;/code> function to get a list of &lt;code>Package&lt;/code> values. In addition, we will use &lt;a class="link" href="https://pkg.go.dev/go/build#Context.Import" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Evolutionary architecture refers to a software design approach that embraces change as a fundamental aspect of system
development. Instead of aiming to create a fixed and perfect architecture upfront, it allows the system to evolve in
response to new requirements, technologies, and insights. Evolutionary architecture is a critical tool for reducing
technical debt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evolutionary design, or incremental design, is another term for this approach. Generally, evolutionary design refers to
changes on a smaller scale, such as refactoring code or adding new features. On the other hand, evolutionary
architecture refers to changes on a larger scale, such as reorganizing the codebase or splitting a monolithic
application into microservices. That said, there is no strict boundary between the two terms. We will use the term
evolutionary architecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, we provide an example of scaling your codebase to accommodate a growing number of features and
developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="current-architecture">&lt;a href="#current-architecture" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>Current architecture
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We base our example on a theoretical codebase, but real-world experiences inspire it. The problems and solutions we
discuss are common in software development, especially in startups and small companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initial state of our example codebase is a web application developed in a mono-repository. The application was built
from the ground up with a simple architecture, focusing on adding new features and finding product-market fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/scaling-codebase-evolutionary-architecture/current-design.png">&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Current design with a few large modules.&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The current design divides the codebase into a few large modules. We use the term &lt;em>module&lt;/em> to mean a logical grouping of
code in the same files and directories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, after a couple of years, the application has grown significantly in features, complexity, and team size. The
organization now has three product teams working on different functional areas of the application. No one has updated
the initial architecture, which is insufficient to support the growing codebase and development team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problems-with-the-current-architecture">&lt;a href="#problems-with-the-current-architecture" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>Problems with the current architecture
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A significant problem that the engineering team has been facing is &lt;strong>an increase in bugs and a longer time to fix
them&lt;/strong>. The code for each feature is sprinkled throughout the codebase and tightly coupled to other seemingly unrelated
features. This complexity makes it difficult to understand, test, and keep existing features working as new ones are
added.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of new features, the team has been struggling to add them on time. The codebase has become a tangled web of
dependencies, and any change in one part of the codebase can have unintended consequences in other parts. Adding a
feature requires modifying many parts of the codebase, which requires understanding the entire codebase, which many
developers lack. The lack of knowledge and the changes to many parts of the codebase have led to &lt;strong>features taking
significantly longer to implement&lt;/strong> than initially estimated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Maintaining feature branches&lt;/strong> for over a few days and making patch fixes to existing releases has become impossible.
The codebase is so intertwined that any changes may cause merge conflicts. The increased likelihood of merge conflicts
has discouraged developers from refactoring and cleaning up the code base. This tendency to leave the code as-is has
perpetuated the slide in code quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tests have also become a problem. The &lt;strong>test suite has been in a frequent state of disrepair&lt;/strong>. There is no clear
ownership of tests, so engineers have been reluctant to fix them. Some engineers have stopped paying attention to
failing CI alerts, figuring that the problems are caused by one of the other two teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tests have also become slower&lt;/strong> and slower, especially the integration tests that test the API and include the service
layer, the datastore layer, and an actual database. These tests do not run in parallel; every additional feature slows
down the compile and increases test time. Test files have become bloated with tests for multiple features, making them
slow to load in the editor, difficult to navigate, and impossible to diff for PR reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the &lt;strong>onboarding time for new developers has been growing&lt;/strong>. It takes weeks for new developers to understand
the codebase and start contributing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="good-architecture">&lt;a href="#good-architecture" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>Good architecture
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>At this point in the company&amp;rsquo;s life, an exemplary architecture would be separate groups of modules corresponding to the
three product teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/scaling-codebase-evolutionary-architecture/ideal-design.png">&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Good design with dedicated modules for each product team.&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Each team would be responsible for its own set of modules, which aligns with Agile principles. The modules would be
loosely coupled, and the teams would be able to work independently on their features without affecting other teams. The
amount of code that each engineer has to understand and change would be drastically reduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This architecture would have eliminated or significantly reduced the problems that the engineering team has been facing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The reduced complexity and increased understanding of the codebase would lead to fewer and faster to fix bugs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster feature development due to cleaner code and fewer dependencies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reduced merge conflicts for PRs, especially for database migrations and schema changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rarely failing test suite due to clear ownership of tests&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster tests due to each team focusing on testing their slice of the product. Limited complete product integration
tests would still be present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster onboarding time for new developers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>However, the company does not have this architecture. Building this architecture upfront would have been foolish since
it would have consumed critical engineering time. Yes, there was value in creating this structure upfront because it
would have saved time in the long run, but this value was insufficient for a young company that may not be around in a
few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="evolutionary-architecture">&lt;a href="#evolutionary-architecture" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>Evolutionary architecture
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Many companies and engineers find themselves in this situation. They have a codebase with poor architecture for today&amp;rsquo;s
reality, blame the organization for not thinking about these problems earlier, and feel like they can&amp;rsquo;t improve the
situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evolutionary architecture is a way to incrementally improve the architecture of a codebase without having to do a big
rewrite. It is a way to make the codebase better today than it was yesterday and better tomorrow than it is today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This situation is not unique to this company. It is the norm. Most companies start with a simple architecture and
codebase that is good enough for the first few features. As the company grows, the architecture becomes a bottleneck.
Instead of worrying about not making the right decisions in the past, consider where the architecture needs to be a year
or two from now and start moving towards that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, when adding a new prominent feature to the product, decouple it from the rest of the codebase.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/scaling-codebase-evolutionary-architecture/evolutionary-design.png">&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Evolutionary design with big features going into dedicated modules.&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Our example shows all the modules decoupled, but it may be OK to decouple one or two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decoupling a feature from the rest of the codebase has many benefits similar to those we listed above for &amp;ldquo;good
architecture.&amp;rdquo; Additional benefits include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Most of the feature can be tested by itself, reducing test time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The business gets the option to create a new team dedicated to the feature quickly &amp;ndash; the code is already
separate/independent&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Engineering can scale the feature separately from the rest of the product. For example, assign a dedicated database or
split the feature into a microservice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="code-example-of-splitting-the-database-schema">&lt;a href="#code-example-of-splitting-the-database-schema" class="header-anchor">&lt;/a>Code example of splitting the database schema
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is nice to read about a theoretical example, but seeing an actual code example is even better. In this code example,
we begin with a monolithic application that has a single database schema. We then split the schema into two separate
schemas. It is the starting point and a reference for decoupling a new feature from the rest of the codebase. Since this
code example is a bit long and requires some context regarding the current implementation, we will not cover it in this
article. Instead, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li1GZzQVXWw&amp;amp;t=1070s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
