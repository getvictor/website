&lt;p>In the ever-evolving landscape of device management and cybersecurity, understanding the mechanics behind tools like Fleet is not just about technical curiosity; it&amp;rsquo;s about empowering IT professionals to safeguard digital assets more effectively. &lt;a class="link" href="https://fleetdm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fleet&lt;/a> gathers telemetry from various devices, from laptops to virtual machines, using &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.osquery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>osquery&lt;/a>. At the heart of this system lies a crucial feature: &lt;a class="link" href="https://fleetdm.com/securing/what-are-fleet-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fleet policies&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Policies in Fleet are more than just rules; they are the gatekeepers of your device&amp;rsquo;s security, ensuring stringent adherence to security standards. By dissecting how Fleet policies operate &amp;ldquo;under the hood,&amp;rdquo; IT administrators and security professionals can gain invaluable insights. These insights allow for setting up efficient security protocols and rapid response to potential vulnerabilities, a necessity in a landscape where cyber threats are constantly evolving. This article delves into the inner workings of Fleet policies, providing you with the knowledge to better configure, manage, and leverage these policies for optimal device security and efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="policy-creation">Policy creation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Policies can be created from the web UI, the command-line interface called &lt;code>fleetctl&lt;/code> with config files, or the REST API. The user creates a policy and selects which devices need to be checked using that policy. Policies can be global or team-specific.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a policy is created, a record for it is stored in the &lt;strong>policies&lt;/strong> table of the MySQL database. A Fleet deployment consists of several servers behind a load balancer, so storing the record in the DB makes all servers aware of the new policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/understanding-the-intricacies-of-fleet-policies/understanding-the-intricacies-of-fleet-policies-policy-creation-1280x720@2x.png"
alt="Fleet policies block diagram">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="policy-execution">Policy execution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Policies are executed on the devices, which are called &lt;strong>hosts&lt;/strong> in Fleet, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/fleet-server-configuration#osquery-policy-update-interval" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>FLEET_OSQUERY_POLICY_UPDATE_INTERVAL&lt;/a>, which is set to 1 hour by default. This interval can be adjusted with the environment variable or set from the server’s command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Policies are simply SQL queries that return a true or false result, so the flow they use on the hosts is the same as other queries. Hosts check in with Fleet servers every 10 seconds (the default) and access the &lt;code>/api/v1/osquery/distributed/read&lt;/code> API endpoint. The server checks when the policy was last executed to determine whether it should be executed again. If so, the server adds the policy to its response. For example, this policy in the server response checks if the macOS firewall is enabled:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>{
&amp;#34;queries&amp;#34;: {
&amp;#34;fleet_policy_query_9&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;SELECT 1 FROM alf WHERE global_state &amp;gt;= 1;&amp;#34;
},
&amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34;: {
&amp;#34;fleet_policy_query_9&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;SELECT 1&amp;#34;
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Once the host has executed the policy, it writes the result to the server. The server updates the result in the &lt;strong>policy_membership&lt;/strong> table of the MySQL database. At this point, the Host Details page on the web UI is updated with the policy result.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/understanding-the-intricacies-of-fleet-policies/understanding-the-intricacies-of-fleet-policies-host-policy-view-1818x1999@2x.png"
alt="Fleet policies on host details page">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="force-policy-execution-on-a-device">Force policy execution on a device&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The user can force the host to execute all of its policies by clicking the &lt;strong>Refetch&lt;/strong> link:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/understanding-the-intricacies-of-fleet-policies/understanding-the-intricacies-of-fleet-policies-refetch-204x64@2x.png"
alt="Fleet refetch host details">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="policy-results-aggregation">Policy results aggregation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>However, the main &lt;strong>Policies&lt;/strong> page is not updated. This page shows the counts of all passing and failing hosts for each policy. A worker process on one of the Fleet servers updates it once an hour. The worker calculates the counts and stores them in the &lt;strong>policy_stats&lt;/strong> table in the database. This is done for better performance of the UI. For customers with 100,000s of hosts that asynchronously report their policy results, calculating the passing and failing counts in real time was noticeably slow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://fleetdm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fleet&lt;/a> is an open-source platform for managing and gathering telemetry from devices such as laptops, desktops, VMs, etc. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.osquery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Osquery&lt;/a> agents run on these devices and report to the Fleet server. One of Fleet’s features is the ability to query information from the devices in near real-time, called &lt;em>live queries&lt;/em>. This article discusses how live queries work “under the hood.”&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-live-query">Why a live query?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Live queries enable administrators to ask near real-time questions of all online devices, such as checking the encryption status of SSH keys across endpoints, or obtaining the uptime of each server within their purview. This enables them to promptly identify and address any issues, thereby reducing downtime and maintaining operational efficiency. These tasks, which would be time-consuming and complex if done manually, are streamlined through live queries, offering real-time insights into the status and posture of the entire fleet of devices helping IT and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="live-queries-under-the-hood">Live queries under the hood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Live queries can be run from the web UI, the command-line interface called &lt;code>fleetctl&lt;/code>, or the REST API. The user creates a query and selects which devices will run that query. Here is an example using &lt;code>fleetctl&lt;/code> to obtain the operating system name and version for all devices:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>fleetctl query --query &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;select name, version from os_version;&amp;#34;&lt;/span> --labels &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;All Hosts&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When a client initiates a live query, the server first creates a &lt;strong>Query Campaign&lt;/strong> record in the MySQL database. A Fleet deployment consists of several servers behind a load balancer, so storing the record in the DB makes all servers aware of the new query campaign.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/get-current-telemetry-from-your-devices-with-live-queries/Live%20Query.png"
alt="Query campaign">&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Query campaign&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As devices called &lt;strong>Hosts&lt;/strong> in Fleet check in with the servers, they receive instructions to run a query. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;#34;queries&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;#34;fleet_distributed_query_140&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;SELECT name, version FROM os_version;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> },
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;#34;fleet_distributed_query_140&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;SELECT 1&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then, the osquery agents run the actual query on their host, and write the result back to a Fleet server. As a server receives the result, it publishes it to the common cache using &lt;a class="link" href="https://redis.io/docs/interact/pubsub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Redis Pub/Sub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only the one server communicating with the client subscribes to the results. It processes the data from the cache, keeps track of how many hosts reported back, and communicates results back to the client. The web UI and &lt;code>fleetctl&lt;/code> interfaces use a &lt;a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>WebSockets API&lt;/a>, and results are reported as they come in. The REST API, on the other hand, only sends a response after all online hosts have reported their query results.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="discover-more">Discover more&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Fleet’s live query feature represents a powerful tool in the arsenal of IT and security administrators. By harnessing the capabilities of live queries, tasks that once required extensive manual effort can now be executed swiftly and efficiently. This real-time querying ability enhances operational efficiency and significantly bolsters security and compliance measures across a range of devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The integration of Fleet with Osquery agents, the flexibility offered by interfaces like the web UI, &lt;code>fleetctl&lt;/code>, and the REST API, and the efficient data handling through mechanisms like Redis Pub/Sub and WebSockets API all come together to create a robust, real-time telemetry gathering system. This system is designed to keep you informed about the current state of your device fleet, helping you make informed decisions quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you reflect on the capabilities of live queries with Fleet, consider your network environment&amp;rsquo;s unique challenges and needs. &lt;strong>What questions could live queries help you answer about your devices?&lt;/strong> Whether it&amp;rsquo;s security audits, performance monitoring, or compliance checks, live queries offer a dynamic solution to address these concerns.&lt;/p>
