[{"content":" Traditionally, network routers used dedicated bare metal machines. However, in the last several years, we’ve seen a rise in software-based routers that can be deployed either on bare metal, on a VM, or even on a container. This means these virtual routers can be used to replace existing router software on an older router. They can run in the cloud. Or they can be installed on do-it-yourself (DIY) hardware. A couple popular open source software-based routers are pfSense and OPNsense.\nWhy use a virtual router? For one, these routers offer enterprise-level features such as build-in VPN support, traffic analysis, and extensive diagnostics, among others. Another reason is that having a virtual router gives you the ability to experiment \u0026ndash; you can install multiple routers on top of your hypervisor, and try all of them out. A third reason is that the virtual router may be only one of many VMs that you run on your hardware. You can use the same piece of hardware to run a router, an ad-blocking service, a media server, and other applications.\nAdvanced virtual router installation and set up When setting up our virtual router, we chose to use PCI Passthrough to allow the virtual router direct access to the NIC hardware. Direct access to hardware improves the latency of our internet traffic. In addition, we wanted our hypervisor to sit behind the router, and not be exposed to the public. This reduces the attack surface for potential bad agents. However, routing hypervisor traffic through the router made our setup a bit tricker. It is like the chicken or the egg dilemma \u0026ndash; how do you put your hypervisor behind the router when the hypervisor is responsible for managing the router? Below is the approach we used when installing pfSense on top of Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE).\nFor the initial installation, we did not use PCI Passthrough and instead used a virtual network bridge (vmbr0). We configured the router VM to start on boot.\nInitial virtual router configuration This allowed us to continue controlling the virtual router through the PVE web GUI. We set up the router and enabled access to it through the serial interface, which we used in the next step. Then, we put the system into its final configuration.\nFinal virtual router configuration In order to finish configuring, we had to plug in a monitor and keyboard into our hardware. We accessed the virtual router via the serial interface from the PVE command line:\nqm terminal 100 We updated the WAN interface to use eth0. At this point, the LAN interface eth1 had access to the internet.\nIn addition, we added a second LAN interface for the network bridge (vmbr0). We made sure firewall configurations for both LAN interfaces were the same.\nNext, from the PVE command line, we updated the PVE IP and gateway to point at the router by modifying the following files.\n/etc/network/interfaces /etc/hosts After rebooting PVE, we had access to the internet and to the PVE Web GUI from our new LAN.\nUpdating router software Using a virtual router with PCI Passthrough creates a unique challenge when doing software updates. What if the new version doesn’t work? What if you lose all internet access.\nWe can mitigate potential issues. First, we recommend always making a backup of the router VM when upgrading. That way we can easily roll back the change. Switching to a backup, however, requires keyboard and monitor access to your hardware, since it must be done via the PVE command line.\nAnother way to safely upgrade is to spin up a second VM running updated router software. The second VM can be either from a backup or brand new. This VM should use virtual network bridges for its connections. Once it is properly configured, we can stop the first router VM and switch the port connections to the second VM. This flow also requires accessing the router via the serial interface to update the WAN/LAN interfaces.\n","date":"2023-11-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/setting-up-a-virtual-router/cover_hu019a91ef521bad7337cb0514ecaaaefc_16004_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/setting-up-a-virtual-router/","title":"Setting up a virtual router"},{"content":" Keychains are the macOS’s method to track and protect secure information such as passwords, private keys, and certificates. Traditionally, the keychain information was stored in files, such as:\n/Library/Keychains/System.keychain /Library/Keychains/apsd.keychain /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain /Users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db In the last several years, Apple also introduced data protection keychains, such as the iCloud Keychain. Although the file-based keychains above are on the road to deprecation in favor of data protection keychains, current macOS systems still heavily rely on them. It is unclear when, if ever, these keychains will be replaced by data protection keychains.\nInspecting file-based keychains has gotten more difficult as Apple deprecated many of the APIs associated with them, such as SecKeychainOpen. In addition, excessive use of these deprecated APIs may result in corruption of the Login Keychain, as mentioned in this osquery issue. By NOT using the deprecated APIs, the user only has access to the following keychains from the above list:\n/Library/Keychains/System.keychain /Users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db Root certificates are missing. And the APSD (Apple Push Service Daemon) keychain is missing, which is used for device management, among other things.\nSo, how can app developers and IT professionals continue to have access to ALL of these keychain files?\nOne way is to continue using deprecated APIs until they stop working. We recommend making a secure copy of the keychain files before accessing them with the APIs.\nAnother option is to use the macOS security command line tool. For example, to list root certificates, do the following:\nsudo security find-certificate -a /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain A third, and hardest, option is to parse the keychain files yourself. Some details on the keychain format are available. Please leave a comment if you or someone else has created a tool to parse Apple keychains.\nThe fourth option is to use an existing tool, such as osquery. Osquery is an open-source tool built for security and IT professionals. Osquery developers are working on fixing any issues to continue providing access to macOS keychain files via the following tables:\ncertificates keychain_acls keychain_items ","date":"2023-11-16T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/inspecting-keychain-files-on-macos/","title":"Inspecting keychain files on macOS"},{"content":" Authorization is giving permission to a user to do an action on the server. As developers, we must ensure that users are only allowed to do what they are authorized.\nOne way to ensure that authorization has happened is to loudly flag when it hasn\u0026rsquo;t. This is how we do it at Fleet Device Management.\nIn our code base, we use the go-kit library. Most of the general endpoints are created in the handler.go file. For example:\n// user-authenticated endpoints ue := newUserAuthenticatedEndpointer(svc, opts, r, apiVersions...) ue.POST(\u0026#34;/api/_version_/fleet/trigger\u0026#34;, triggerEndpoint, triggerRequest{}) Every endpoint calls kithttp.NewServer and wraps the endpoint with our AuthzCheck. From handler.go:\ne = authzcheck.NewMiddleware().AuthzCheck()(e) return kithttp.NewServer(e, decodeFn, encodeResponse, opts...) This means that after the business logic is processed, the AuthzCheck is called. This check ensures that authorization was checked. Otherwise, an error is returned. From authzcheck.go:\n// If authorization was not checked, return a response that will // marshal to a generic error and log that the check was missed. if !authzctx.Checked() { // Getting to here means there is an authorization-related bug in our code. return nil, authz.CheckMissingWithResponse(response) } This additional check is useful during our development and QA process, to ensure that authorization always happens in our business logic.\nThis article originally appeared in Fleet\u0026rsquo;s blog.\n","date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://victoronsoftware.com/posts/catch-missed-authorization-checks-during-software-development/","title":"Catch missed authorization checks during software development"}]
